                <p>
                    Tyler has a fascination with Old Earth detective fiction. This led to a common hobby shared with his friends in role-playing Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson on the Holodeck; he has read all the Holmes books. That interest evolved into legitimate theatre
                    as well as music, where he has studied the violin, guitar, oboe and flute and plays in shipboard performances.

                    Ismail is an accomplished diplomat and tactician, He managed to surpass a 22-year career as first officer and later captain of the U.S.S. Stargazer with an even more impressive record as captain of the fleet's former flagship U.S.S. Enterprise. Though
                    he often heatedly defends a strict interpretation of the Prime Directive, he has broken it numerous times when he felt it was warranted.

                <h4>React I</h4>
                <p>
                    Albert who is DS9's first Starfleet chief of operations, was born with a deep pride in his Irish ancestry, traced back to medieval King Brian Boru and 1902 American labor martyr Sean Aloysius O'Brien. The family, which also included two brothers, was
                    living near a small town on Earth — most probably in Ireland — by the time he was of age, and his mother cooked unreplicated meat-and-potatoes meals.

                    Nico considers himself a history buff but is not big on 21st-century Earth, calling it too depressing. Though an aficionado of food such as Klingon racht, even alive, and Vulcan plomeek soup, he doesn't like beets. He once saw a "memorable" exhibit of
                    Seyetik's huge murals on Ligobis X and has learned about Bajoran music since arriving on DS9.

                    Alexis has consistently shown to be not only thorough but conscientious in her daily work and routine. She is a superior scientist in various fields of research such as xenoimmunology, curing or treating the so-called Tsiolkovsky virus, the airborne virus
                    known as Ligonese poison, and Barclay Syndrome, which she discovered and named after its first patient, Reginald Barclay.
